# Scilla
A performance focused, lightweight game framework, built from the ground up using wgpu and winit

# What is it?
It is a game framework built to use all of the capabilities of a machine.

# What is it not?
It is not a fully featured game engine. There are no plans to add a Scene System, or a ECS.
However, you can add your own using crates that exist extremely easily!
